â”œâ”€â”€ candle-generator<br/>
â”œâ”€â”€ api<br/>
â””â”€â”€ web

## Architecture ðŸ”¶

This application has 3 parts:

The first is the **candle-generator**. This gets the Bitcoin exchange rate from the Coingecko API and enqueue on RabbitMQ.

The second one is the **main API**. This consumes the queue from RabbitMQ and send candle data to the web client.

The last part is the **web client**. This receive candle data to plot a candle chart.

## How to try ðŸ”¥

- Open **3 terminals**;
- Enter the **/candle-generator** folder and execute **yarn dev**;
- Enter the **/api** folder and execute **yarn dev**;
- Enter the **/web** folder, execute **yarn dev** and open **http://localhost:5173** on your browser.

Alternatively, use a process manager as **[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)** to run all parts simultaneously.
